using open source software to create/test/manage escape rooms and axe bars and maybe other businesses too. all of my businesses will be protected by the eye of odin himself.\
\
my axe bar is viking themed, and my wife and I often make jokes with the "under his eye" line from <i>The Handmaid's Tale</i> so here we are. Under Odin's Eye.\
\
Small businesses are the biggest losers in the software-to-manage-my-business space. The big offerings are holy shit expensive and the ones with better features have saas fees as a % of revenue, which to me sounds ridiculous.\
\
I have enough experience in business both as a software user, and a software vendor, to know that there is no all-in-one software solution for your business. The needs of the niche businesses are many.

**booking software**

Escape rooms, for instance need to be able to schedule 1 booking per escape room. This is usually a 60 minute game time that schedules every 90 minutes. That gives game masters a 30 minute break in between games to get the game reset and the next group in. That's fairly easy. Axe bars, on the other hand have a lot more flexibility in how they can package their product and make it easier for their customers to buy. The more niche needs of an axe bar are things like being able to offer a variable amount of time to book. If you give someone a 30,60,90,120 sessions, I bet you book more 90 and 120 minute sessions than you'd think. If the option presents a complicated UI to have that work, it's not worth doing so you pick one hour and lose the revenue.

**cctv**

every business needs a cctv system. Usually small businesses buy these shit box systems for $399 at some big box retailer and run these looooooong ass cords to connect back to the shit box dvr.\
\
escape rooms each have their own cctv system to monitor game play. our needs are different than that of a normal cctv user and I will list them below, but the cctv system is a major bottleneck in my industry and I think this can solve it.\

1. ideally we would be able to stream the audio from 1/some/all cameras
